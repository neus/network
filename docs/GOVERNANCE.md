# Governance

**How NEUS is governed from Genesis through DAO launch.**

## Current Model

- **Maintainer-led**: NEUS Network, Inc. guides development to ship fast and keep the protocol stable.
- **Decision scope**: Protocol and development decisions by maintainers; smart‑contract changes gated by multisig + timelock.
- **Community input**: Feedback and ideas are welcomed during Genesis via issues and discussions.

## Mainnet Plan

- **DAO at mainnet**: The NEUS DAO will be constituted to launch and govern the ecosystem utility token.
- **Scope**: DAO controls protocol parameters and the DAO treasury (bootstrapped via multisig + timelock, transitioning to on‑chain voting).
- **Company role**: NEUS Network, Inc. operates the Hub, hosted APIs/indexers, and infrastructure as a supporting service provider.
- **Timing**: As quickly as feasible after Genesis; subject to audits, security, and applicable law.

## Contract Safeguards

- **Multisig + timelock** for sensitive actions
- **Emergency pause/circuit breakers**
- **Authorized relayer allow‑list** (add/rotate/remove)

## Participation

- **What you get**: Hub beta access, on‑chain recognition, structured feedback channels.
- **What it isn’t**: No equity, no profit share, no current governance rights, no guaranteed token allocations.

## Licensing

- **Core contracts**: Business Source License 1.1 with automatic conversion to Apache 2.0 on Aug 1, 2028.
- **Earlier conversion**: The DAO may consider earlier conversion via formal governance once established.

## Transparency

- **Open source** with published changelogs and independent audits before/after mainnet.
- **Treasury and governance records** will be published at/after mainnet.

## Legal Notes

- **Utility only**: Any token is intended for use/governance in the ecosystem—not an investment.
- **No ownership or profits** in NEUS Network, Inc. from participation.
- **Subject to change**: Governance design and timelines may adjust for security, audits, and compliance.
- **Terms apply**: Your use is subject to Terms of Use, NFT Sale Terms, and Privacy Policy.
